// ! Write a program that takes a string as input and returns a count of how many words in the string can be rearranged to form palindromes.
// ! You may assume that input strings are at least 1 character in length and contain only alphabetic characters. You may ignore case for the purpose of assessing possible palindromes.

// define string
// define palindrome

// ! ex. Processing the string “aaa bca Abab” should return the integer 2 because “aaa” is already a palindrome and “Abab” can be rearranged to “Abba”, which is also a palindrome (case insensitive). Thus, two of the three words in the string can be made into palindromes.
